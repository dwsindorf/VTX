# VTX
A completely proceedural full Universe generation program with arbitrary level of detail

VTX stands for "Virtual Terrain EXplorer"

The program is designed to generate an intire Universe containing galaxies, Stars, Planets and Moons
with an arbirary size and level of detail using completely procedural techniques.

The project is based on WXWidgets for the UI, OpenGL for the graphics and C++ for the programming lanquage
It is totally cross-platform and can be build and run on Windows, Linux and (peresumbably)
Apple operating systems (although a port to the Mac has not been tested)

It also utilizes a unique text-based descripion lanquage that allows user generated scenes to be 
created and modified via a standard text editor or using the extensive graphical editing 
interfaces available within the application

Some screenshots of previously generated scenes are available in the Images sub-directory

NOTE: This README is just an initial check-in and will be ammended in the future
      to include instructions for building and running the program.
