-----------------
1. Enable flag doesn't affect whether or not or how layers get drawn
2. If terrain contains PX,PY layers render/adapt times are extremely long if object is not viewobj
   -fixed
3. In "h" off case get holes in triangle mesh
4. Far off orbital views of clouds and sky show z-depth precision artifacts

-----------------
1. Coronas don't show if pixel noise selected and star is not viewobj
  - work-around needed to render star first or set mode to internal
2. need to make sure github ".ignore" directories are created on first use if not present
  - specifically, Bitmaps/tmp (done)
3. Can't "Replace with" if Objects/<type> doesn't exist 
  - fixed
4. need to compile VtxScene.cpp with -g flag (vs -O3) otherwise get crash (segment violation) when program starts
  - deferred (windows only problem)
  - work-aroung is to compile all wx directory with -g (doesn't seem to affect performance)
5. Colored textures too light unless bumpmap is enabled
6. adding fractal to terrain should be below ocean
7. replacing moon (luna) crashed program
8. selecting Set view earth crashed program
9. selecting lines mode on surface crashed program
10. dragging point above fractal (to add small features) didn't work (needed to edit text file manually)
11. Center text doesn't show up on Linux or windows laptop
12. orbital distances sometimes get reset to 204 MM
13. after adding new texture need to restart program for it to show up in list
14. artifacts seen at water boundary if fog enabled
 - not noticable at high or better resolutions
15. following set view(?) -/+ move up down etc. has huge value
 - need to goto new surface point to fix
16. sometimes parent planet shows through sky etc. ion moon surface view
  - rebuild, change view etc. doesn't fix. need to restart program (last.spx) to fix
  - related (same?) problem seen after turning shadows on and off
  - somewhat fixed by always clearing depth buffer in render passes (SceneClass) related to raster.set_farview()
17. moons don't show up in front of planet in orbital views
18. save does not save all bitmaps used by textures ()
