Notes for Eclipse (Indigo) Ubuntu (12.04) WxWidgets 2.9.4
Problems:
1. Can't find header files (e.g. <stdio.h>) in txt editor views
  - Set C/C++ build tool chain editor to Linux GCC
  - Enable "automatic discovery of paths and symbols" in  C/C++->discovery options
2. Undefined methods (e.g. printf)
  There seems to be a bug in this version of CDT
  Work-around
  - in  C/C++->discovery options "compiler invocation arguments"
    change: -E -P -v -dD ${plugin_state_location}/specs.cpp
    to: -E -P -v -dD ${plugin_state_location}/specs.cpp $> ~/dummyfile
  - and in entry for "load build output from file"
    enter: ~/dummyfile
  - force rebuild of indexer
    change something, then press "apply"
  - Undefined errors should stop showing up in "problems" and test files
  - Restoring "compiler invocation arguments" and "load build output from file"
    to original values does not undo fix (something is getting cached)
3. Undefined wxWidgets header files
  - Need to add path to /usr/local/include/wx-2.9 to "paths and symbols" (all builds and lanquages)
4. Undefined wxWidgets symbols
  - Go to wxWidges build directory
    e.g. /opt/wxWidgets/wxWidgets-2.9.4/release
  - search for file "setup.h"
    e.g. /opt/wxWidgets/wxWidgets-2.9.4/release/lib/wx/include/gtk3-unicode-static-2.9/wx
  - cp setup.h to wxWidgets install wx include directory 
    e.g. /usr/local/include/wx-2.9/wx
