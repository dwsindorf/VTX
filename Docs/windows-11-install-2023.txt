Installation notes and issues windows 11 installation (march 2023)
I. cygwin
 1. installed g++ 11.02 (later versions generate errors when compiling wxWidgets)
 2. using g++ (in C:\cygwin64\bin) results in linker error
    - have to set CC in Makefile to "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe"
    - or overwrite g++ in C:\cygwin64\bin with x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe
      do the same for gcc (using "C:\cygwin64\bin\x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe")
II. wxWidgets
  1. checked out ans build version 3.0 (initially got build errors for 3.1 3.2)
    - but need to recheck if problem exists after the above fix for cygwin
III. building
  1. changed all tests for null pointer from ptr>0 to ptr !=0 (otherwize get compile errors)
  2. need to create system environment variabe "PLATFORM" and set it to "WIN" 
  2. need to disable optimize (-O3) for wxWidgets directory only or get crash (core dump) shortly after program starts
     - briefly see scene image then get crash
     - need to find out where problem is occuring
IV.  unresolved problems
  1. text doesn't appear in glcanvas
  2. no print statements show up in terminal or console window (both vscode and eclipse)
     - however, they do show if vtx is run in an external git-bash terminal
